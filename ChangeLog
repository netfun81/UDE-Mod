 	marked strings. 

	* uwm/init.c (SetLanguage): The function becomes obsolete so it 
	was removed.

	* src/workspaces.c (SetWSBackground): When the root window's pixmap
	is changed the server is grabbed to avoid memory leaks and some
	properties are changed to let the applications know that the pixmap
	has been changed. see the FIXME note!

	* src/uwm.h (struct): added new SetBackground entry, this array
	will determine if the background color must be changed.

	* src/init.c (AllocWSS): added support for new SetBackground 
	structure member.
	(AllocWSS): changed multiple "for" statements with the same limits
	for one "for" only.

	default bahaviour is to not touch the background when the WS is 
	changed.

	then TheScreen.SetBackground[TheScreen.ActiveWorkSpace] is set to 1
	in order to let SetWSBackground know that the background color must
 	be changed.

	changed only if 'TheScreen.SetBackground [TheScreen.ActiveWorkSpace]'
	is not zero (0).
