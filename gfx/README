How to generate an uwm hex icon set in three steps

1. Use your favourite painting program to draw the icons. Pay attention that
   the transparent areas are really transparent and save all icons in the same
   directory under the following names:
     - autorise.xpm   inactive autorise icon
     - autorises.xpm  active autorise icon
     - back.xpm       inactive "send window to background" icon
     - backs.xpm      active "send window to background" icon
     - close.xpm      inactive "close window" icon
     - closes.xpm     active "close window" icon
     - iconify.xpm    inactive "iconify window" icon
     - iconifys.xpm   active "iconify window" icon
     - kill.xpm       inactive "xkill client" icon
     - kills.xpm      active "xkill client" icon
     - menu.xpm       inactive "window menu" icon
     - menus.xpm      active "window menu" icon
     - really.xpm     inactive "really xkill client?" icon
     - reallys.xpm    active "really xkill client?" icon
   The icons can have arbitrary shapes and sizes but it is recommended that the
   active version of an icon completely overlaps the inactive version as to
   avoid flickering effects. Only XPM file format is supported.
2. Set the coordinates of each icon's upper left corner relative to the hex
   menu's center using the coordadd script from the extras/tools directory of
   the uwm source distribution. This script can also be downloaded from
   https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/udeproject/uwm/branches/BRANCH-0.2/extras/tools/coordadd
   The hex menu's center is the initial position of the mouse pointer inside
   the hex menu.
3. Set the HexPath variable in your config file to the directory where you
   saved the hex icons and restart uwm.
