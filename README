README for uwm 0.2.10
=====================

This is uwm, the ultimate window manager, which will be one day part of
ude, the unix desktop environment.

See the files INSTALL and INSTALL.UDE for compilation and installation
instructions.

For documentation on how to use and configure uwm, please check out the
file manual.dvi in the doc directory or the html documentation tree.

Please note that our url at ude.org is no longer available, the project
has migrated to sourceforge and can be reached at

                     http://udeproject.sourceforge.net.

Mirror pages also might be down or outaged due to some problems with the
migration.

Oh, and don't forget: We're still looking for developers, designers etc.
The more people work on this project the higher the chances are that one
day we'll reach a major version number of 1 (i.e. "all" features
implemented).
Contact me if you're interested.

ude - get used to it.


For bug reports, suggestions etc. please contact
