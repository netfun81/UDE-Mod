We don't have a lot of system requirements, but at the moment there are the
following two things:

* your X-Server must support the shapes-extension
* you should have the XPM-libraries installed on your system which are 
  available under some kind of freeware-license via ftp on:
         ftp.x.org in /contrib  or  koala.inria.fr in /pub/xpm
  and should work on all unix-systems with X-windows. 

At least the first requirement is met by almost every modern X-server.
The second one should (if your system hasn't installed xpm-lib by default anyway
which should be the case on most unixes with X) not be a problem to you sice you
can simply download and install the really small library.

if your system meets both requirements and you still can't compile uwm, please
send a bug report with detailed description of your systems and a copy of
the make-output you got to:
