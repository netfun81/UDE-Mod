#!/bin/sh
# This is an example start-script for uwm. There have been changes since
# version 0.1.10b: Due to BSD-compatibility (where's no bash available by
# default) and user requests we don't force you to use a script anymore. This
# comes along with the necessity to include #!/shellpath/shellcommand as the
# first line of your scripts. #!/bin/sh should work on most systems, however
# you can use any shell of your choice. This should also enable more complex
# applications than only starting your favourite programs (oh, if you want to
# start more than one application at a time don't forget the '&'s after the
# command lines), e.g. check for new mail and only start your e-mail-program
# if there is some etc. You can now also include a single shell-command 
# directly into uwmrc such as StartScript="tkdesk" if there's only one program
# to start. If you quote the command it may also contain space-characters.
# If you use a script mark it as executeable (use chmod).

# this is very simple and will only display the Readme-file.
