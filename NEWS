  files.
* urdb option added which takes xrdb-files as input files, processes some
  additional macros and sets X11-resources to your personal preference
  (workspace-dependent)

  uwmrc.
* if a c preprocessor is found on the system all configuration files are now
  passed through it before being processed by uwm.

  uwmrc is found. in case no appmenu's fount either a simple xterm is added to
  the application menu.
* Bugfix: uwm shouldn't segfault any longer in case you overwrite a previously
  loaded screen background pixmap with no pixmap (or in case the second pixmap
  is not found).


V0.2.6-BETA:

* ATTENTION: Installation procedures and language support have completely
  changed, please read the files INSTALL.UDE, INSTALL, README and ABOUT-NLS
  for more information about this.
* uwm now cares about MWM_HINTS (Motif WM Hints) in a simple way i.e. we don't
  decorate windows with MWM_HINTS set and no function or decoration specified
  any longer. (xmms and X11amp should be treated correctly now)
* uwm now has an option to warp the pointer to the center of newly mapped
  windows. this is especially useful in case you use big virtual screens or
  use programs which take their main input from the keyboard but pop up windows
  from tine to time.
* you can now place a window manually without having to grab the mouse: simply
  hit return or enter.
* uwm will now broadcast information for UDElib programs (as a preparation for

* Bugfix: uwm won't execute StopScript anymore in case you restart it without
  StartScript.

* ReBugfix: refixed the XEmacs bug. To fix both Xemacs bug and 'lost windows
  bug' at the same time, we have to 'bend' the specification a little bit: we're
  now overriding USPosition in case the window is positioned outside of the
  visible screen area. I hope there won't be any problems occuring because of
  this.

* the MawWinWidth and MaxWinHeight options are now implemented which allow you
  to define a maximum size for newly opened and reconfigured windows. This
  should be useful on low resolution displays, e.g. on laptops etc.
* you can now select several items from the application menu without having to
  close and reopen the menu after each selection. simply press and release any
  button above the desired item. Please note that if the last button is released
  above the most previously selected item to close the menu the program will not
  be loaded twice.
* changed menu scrolling option to prevent unnecessary scrolling of menus
  fitting completely on the screen.

  feature.
* OpaqueMoveSize-option now implemented which makes it possible to move small
  windows opaque and bigger ones (e.g. depending on your server speed)
  transparent.
* Workspace-zapping with the hexagonal winmenu and the uwm-menu is now possible
  in both directions (try out your mouse-buttons!)
* some internal optimisation (PrepareIcons, MyCalloc).
* Spaces are now allowed in uwmrc.
* uwm now finally draws Bevels on the window-borders to give them the typical
  3D-look. Thanx to Adam Sampson for the main parts of this feature.
* uwm now regards the input-flag in WMHints. With this window management
  routines should be complete, so this is V0.2.0-BETA.
* uwm will now send WM_TAKE_FOCUS-events which are expected by some programs
  like xmupad etc.
* added an option to run and restart uwm without executing the StartScript.
  type uwm --help for more info and take a look at the 'UWM Menu'.
* ScreenCommand-option implemented which allows executing a command to set the
  background of a workspace (e.g. xsnow or xearth). Thanx to Adam Sampson for
  this feature.
* ReadFrom-option implemented which enables including configfiles of uwmrc-
  format into uwmrc similar to FILE-option in the menufiles. Thanx to Jonathan
  Heusser for this feature.
* Bugfix: uwm will now activate a moved or resized window and keep it active
  to prevent errors and strange behaviour. uwm will furthermore activate
  windows when the hexagonal window-menu is activated on them to show you
  which window you are operating on.
* Bugfix: uwm will now also display shaped windows correctly if TitleHeight is
  not set to 0.
* Bugfix: window resizing now also works correctly with windows with negative
  coordinates.


V0.1.11-BETA:

* changed the StartScript option to work also directly with executeables.
  ATTENTION: To use a script you now have to mark it as executeable and you 
  must add #!/shellpath/shellcommand into it as first line (e.g. #!/bin/sh ).
  See example uwmrc for details.
* changed the application execution from execvp to execlp(sh -c ... which should
  enable you using shell escapes like ~. Thanx to Adam Sampson for the right
  hint at the right time ;)
  ATTENTION: make sure that all your quoted commands in uwmrc (ShellScript=...)
  and your menu-files have correct shell-syntax. There were some things accepted
  in older versions that are no longer accepted now (e.g. if you use a # you now
  must write \\# instead (one backslash for the shell and one for uwm!))
* some internal mudularisation as preparation for uds.
* Bugfixes:
    - windows iconified at start or restart of uwm are now also listed in
      the windows-menu.
    - windows made sticky from another workspace will no longer disappear
      forever.
    - Menus active while workspaces change will now always change their color
      properly.
    - In case manual placement starts while a menu or winmenu is open uwm will
      no longer hang up after placing the window: place the window by releasing
      and pressing the button again and finally release it over the desired
      item to choose.


V0.1.10b-BETA:

* Following bugfixes:
    - can be compiled on BSD- and glibc-systems again (sigaction
      incompatibility, extern char **environ; doesn't rely on unistd.h anymore)
    - removed several 'error #3'-messages. (alive-flag in DeultimizeWin)


V0.1.10-BETA:

* Files included into other menu-files will no longer be stupidly appended to
  the corresponding menue structure but merged into it. Decision is made by
  item-names. This will e.g. enable you merging a system-wide default-menue
  into each user's personal menu structure with a simple FILE-command.
* Environment variables will be dereferenced now in filenames in Config-files.
* removed the menu-flickering bug.
* changed the mouse-pointer-changeing-routines of the menues to work correctly.
* X11-borders are now removed from non-override-redirect-windows before
  reparenting.


V0.1.9-BETA:

* Bugfix (manual window-placement won't hang up in a winmenu if mouse is pressed
  above another window's border anymore)
* another Bugfix (uwm won't bother you anymore with the errors caused by command
  #12 at startup ;) )
* some fine-tuning on the placement-strategy.
* changed the window- and workspace-management to a proper unique menu.
* finally started implementing the window-menue:
            - sticky windows supported now.
            - move windows directly to desired workspace.


V0.1.8-BETA:

* minor changes in the placement-strategy (we are now also replaceing 
  windows that are not completely visible on the screen in any way).
* Some Key-shortcuts:
            - Zap through the workspaces by pressing Ctrl-Alt-(Left/Right).
            - Zap through the windows on each workspace by pressing
              Ctrl-Alt-(Up/Down).
            - Raise/lower a window by pressing Ctrl-Alt-(PgUp/PgDown).
            - Iconify a window by pressing Ctrl-Alt-End.
  More to come on your request. One day (I hope) they'll be configureable
  somehow.
* A little Bugfix (the autorise-button in the window-menu should now work
  correctly.)


V0.1.7-BETA:

* Implementation of two more placement-strategies (interactive placement,
  user placement)
* Implementation of the 'workspace-zapper' which enables zapping through the
  workspaces with a single mouse-click: click any mouse-button while the
  WM-menue is active.
* Moving windows to another workspace is possible now: click the middle-button
  while the window-menu is active
* you can now restart ude, e.g. to reconfigure after changing the config-files


V0.1.6-BETA:

* Implementation of a simple placement-strategy. There'll probably be further
  ones to choose in far future...
* a little bugfix from V0.1.5b (windows initially iconified and then mapped by
  the program itself are now treated correctly)
* Support of the TitleHeight-option in uwmrc, altough I don't see much sense in
  it.


V0.1.5b-BETA:

* just a bugfix to V0.1.5-BETA


V0.1.5-BETA:

* you can now also specify absolute/relative pathnames for menufiles
* you can now include menu-files into other menu-files
* you can now choose which button will display which menu

* you can now configure the uwm-buttons to your personal preference.
* you can now choose wether your uwm-menues should be transient or not
  (see uwmrc for details)
* The workspace-manager is now implemented
* several internal bugfixes


V0.1.4-BETA:

* you can now choose wether you prefer transparent or opaque window movement
* you can now configure the uwm-menues to your preferred size
* the start-script-option is supported now
* uwm now decorates transient windows with a different border-width (I'll add
  some configuration-features to this later)
* uwm now sets the WM_STATE property correctly so that e.g. TkDesks Netscape
  remote-control and XF86Setup will work


V0.1.3-BETA:

* Multiple Colormap support (each window may now have its own colormap
* Catching windows at startup should now work correctly
* quotes are now possible in quoted terms in the application-menu-configfile by
  typeing \", backslashes work with \\ etc...
